Clean Code. Robert Martin
===========================

 - 1 . [Chapter 1: Clean Code][d]
 
 Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally agreed upon. These are 
 guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of 
 Clean Code.
 
 Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are still learning a lot. When software 
 architecture is as old as architecture itself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these
  guidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the Java code that you and your team produce.
 
 One more thing: knowing these won't immediately make you a better software developer, and working with them for many 
 years doesn't mean you won't make mistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting shaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when we review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need improvement. Beat up the code instead!
